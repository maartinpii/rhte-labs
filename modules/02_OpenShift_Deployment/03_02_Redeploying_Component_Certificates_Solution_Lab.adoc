== Component Certificates Redeployment Lab

This lab depends up the first lab, "OpenShift Certificate Authorities Redeployment Lab." If that is not complete, this lab will fail.

Components of the OpenShift system have their own certificate authorities (CAs). In the previous lab, you updated the Platform CA with the Intermediate CA certificate. The system continued to function because deploying the new CA certificates affects only new server certificates signed by this CA, not existing ones.

In this lab, you redeploy the certificates of the rest of the OpenShift cluster. New certificates are generated--each from their own CA certificates appropriate for their component type. You see that some CA certificates change, while other do not.

Finally, you make the Intermediate CA certificate available to your client tools, i.e., your web browser and `oc` command line tools. Without the Intermediate CA certificate available to the client tools, they have no way of verifying the certificate presented by OpenShift.  The tools would then present a certificate verification error when accessing the OpenShift, and then prompt you to accept unknown certificates.  With the Intermediate CA certificate available to your client tools, the certificates presented by OpenShift can be verified successfully, and the there are no certificate verification errors.

=== Prepare Environment

. Log in to your OpenShift Bastion host and switch to the `root` user.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo -i
----

* If this was a high availability environment, the OpenShift Master API service would be accessed through the load balancer.

. Find the proper hostname and port of the Master API from the  `openshift_master_cluster_hostname` variable in the Ansible inventory file, and put it in a shell variable for ease of use:
+
[source,bash]
----
MASTER_API_HOSTPORT=`awk -F"[= ]" '/openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname/ {print $2}' /etc/ansible/hosts`:443; echo $MASTER_API_HOSTPORT
----

. Set an environment variable with your environment's GUID.
+
[source,bash]
----
export GUID=$(hostname | cut -f2 -d.); echo $GUID
----


. Do the same for the router on the infrastructure node--the port number is `443`:
+
[source,bash]
----
ROUTER=infranode1.${GUID}.internal:443; echo ${ROUTER}
----



== Examine Existing Certificates

. Examine the existing server certificates using `openssl s_client` to connect to the master:
+
[source,bash]
----
echo QUIT | openssl s_client -connect ${MASTER_API_HOSTPORT} 2>&1 | more
----
+
.Sample Output

* Note that the "Subject" field of the `ca.crt` certificate in the previous lab matches the certificates in the `Certificate chain` section.

. Examine the router's certificates:

---

Server Temp Key: ECDH, prime256v1, 256 bits
----
* Note that the router has a different CA certificate and does _not_ express any client CA names.


== Redeploy and Validate Certificates

. Run the `redeploy-certificates.yml` Ansible Playbook:
+
[source,bash]
----
time ansible-playbook -i /etc/ansible/hosts -v -f 20 /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml
----
* This command takes about six minutes to complete.

. Now that the certificates are redeployed, examine the certificates offered by the OpenShift Master API:
+
[source,bash]
----
echo QUIT | openssl s_client -connect ${MASTER_API_HOSTPORT} 2>&1 | less
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text]
----

----
* Expect the certificate chain in the output to be significantly different from the certificate chain displayed earlier.
* Expect to see that the Intermediate certificate of the Platform CA signed the server certificate.

=== Configure Bastion Host `oc` Command with new CA Certificates

By depoying new CA keys and certificates, the certificate on the Bastion host for the `system:admin` user is now incorrect.  The certificate for the `system:admin` user was regenerated on the master.  It must be copied to the Bastion host in order to continue using the `oc` occmand on the bastion host.

. Execute the following steps on the Bastion host to put the proper configuration file with the `system:admin` certificates in place.
+
[source, bash, numbered]
----
mv /root/.kube/ /root/.oldkube
ansible masters[0] -m fetch -a"src=/root/.kube/config dest=/root/.kube/config flat=yes"
----
+
[TIP]
Use `sudo` to copy the file to the home directory and change its permissions.
Then `scp` the file to the proper place on your bastion.

. Run the `oc` command once from the Bastion, while indicating the proper CA certificate.
+
[source, bash]
----
oc login -u user1 -p 'r3dh4t1!' --certificate-authority=/root/certs/ca/intermediate/certs/intermediate.cert.pem
----
+
Further `oc` commands on the bastion host root user, even logouts and logins, will not require the `--certificate-authortiy=` option.

== Configure Web Browser

=== Copy Intermediate CA Certificate

. On the bastion host, copy the Intermediate certificate to your user's home directory in order to `scp` it to your laptop.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo -i
cp /root/certs/ca/intermediate/certs/intermediate.cert.pem /home/<OpenTLC username>/
chown <OpenTLC username> /home/<OpenTLC username>/intermediate.cert.pem
----

. On your laptop, download the following file via scp from your bastion to your laptop using `scp`:
+
[source,bash]
----
scp -i <Your OpenTLC private key> <OpenTLC username>@bastion.${GUID}.example.opentlc.com:intermediate.cert.pem .
----
*  This is the Intermediate CA certificate that signed most of OpenShift's server certificates. Note the location it was downloaded.

=== Test Intermediate CA Certificate

. Browse to your master's public hostname at `https://loadbalancer.$GUID.example.opentlc.com/`, making sure to substitute your GUID for the `$GUID` in the URL.
* Note that you do not get a certificate error. You are able to log in and browse without warnings or errors.

== Summary

In this lab we ran through the very typical activities of an OpenShift consultant at a security-aware customer:

* Redployed Component Certificates using the ansible playbook
* Validated the redeployed certificates were indeed the certificate we intended
* Configured our web browsers to work with the new Intermediate CA Certificate
